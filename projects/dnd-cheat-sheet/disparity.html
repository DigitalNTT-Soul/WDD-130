        <h1>If Combat has more rules, is it more important?</h1>
        <p>
            It’s an astoundingly common trait of TTRPG’s that the rules of combat make up a large portion of the rules in most Systems. Some players and Game Masters interpret this fact to mean that combat is the most important part of most TTRPG, and, while we don’t blame them for thinking that, we do think they’re being a bit short-sighted to assume that the pillar with the most rules attached to it is the pillar with the most importance attached to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our perspective, the actual reason the rules of combat tend to be so in-depth is twofold. It is partly because combat is the pillar where one player’s accomplishments can be directly compared to another’s in an apples-to-apples fashion, and therefore each player wants and expects to be able to contribute positively to a combat encounter, and they are often disappointed if they are unable to contribute as much as other players. As a result, most rule systems endeavor to give most characters some way of contributing to a combat encounter that is both thematic and fair. The other notable reason that TTRPG’s tend to emphasize the rules of Combat over the rules of Exploration and Socialization is that Combat is drastically more objective than the other two pillars, and objective topics are much easier to write rules for than subjective topics, as most people in the field of Law will tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
            So no, Combat is not more important in the rules systems of TTRPG’s. It can however be made more important if the Game Master chooses to emphasize it in line with their and their players’ own interests and preferences for the game.
