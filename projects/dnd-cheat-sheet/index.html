        <h1>Introduction to TTRPG's</h1>
        <p>
            If you’re reading this, then either you or someone who wants to hang out with you are interested in playing a Table-Top Role-Playing Game (often abbreviated to “Table-Top RPG” or just “TTRPG”), such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Cyberpunk, or something similar to them. If you’ve ever felt intimidated by those games or thought to yourself that those games sound way too complicated for you, you wouldn’t be alone in that.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this website is designed and intended to combat that feeling by explaining exactly what all of those game systems have in common, and showing you exactly how simple they truly are on a fundamental level.
        </p>

            Table-Top RPG’s, much like other sub-categories of RPG, tend to revolve around the “3 Pillars of Role-Playing,” which are Combat, Socialization, and Exploration. Some RPG’s (most commonly in video games) may forgo the Combat pillar, but the ones who succeed without it are much rarer, and must lean heavily on the Exploration and/or Socialization pillars as a result, a la Sherlock Holmes or Animal Crossing.

            <li>
                The Combat pillar focuses on how violent interactions between characters are resolved.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Exploration pillar focuses on how characters interact with the surrounding game-world.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Socialization pillar focuses on how non-violent interactions between characters are resolved.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Vocabulary: "System" vs "Game"</h2>
        <p>
            It’s also important to note that, specifically for Table-Top RPG’s, the term “Game” does not refer to “Dungeons and Dragons”, or “Pathfinder”, etc. In the greater context of the TTRPG community, those are referred to as “Systems” because they are merely theme-focused rule-systems that outline how the players interact with the fictional world the game takes place in. So what does the word “Game” mean in the context of a TTRPG? Generally, it refers to a specific storyline, being run by a specific Game Master (fancy term for “Main Storyteller and Rules Referee”; sometimes also called a “Dungeon Master”), and usually on a specific day of the week. The system used is largely considered to be mostly irrelevant to the identity of the game, and some games have been known to transition from one system to another in the middle of the story for any reason or none at all (as long as the players all agree to the change, of course), such as the first campaign of the famous “Critical Role” campaign switching from Pathfinder to 5th-edition Dungeons and Dragons when they transitioned from being a podcast to being a Twitch stream. For example, if your friend Daniel is running a heist storyline in one of the Cyberpunk rule systems (and its associated theme) every Monday, most of the players would refer to it either as “Daniel’s heist game” or “Daniel’s Monday game”.
