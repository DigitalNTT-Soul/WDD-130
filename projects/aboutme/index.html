    <p>Hey, everybody, I’m Dylan Ruppell, resident nerd extraordinaire from Knoxville, Tennessee, United States of America. My hobbies and interests include math, science, puzzles, sudoku, escape rooms, computer programming (which I’ve been dabbling in since summer 2013 shortly after my 15th birthday), gaming (of the video and tabletop varieties), and watching your traditional nerdy things like Marvel movies, Anime, Science Fiction, Fantasy Fiction, Star Wars, Star Trek, Star Gate (a lot of star-related sci-fi stuff), and crime dramas (like “The Rookie” and “NCIS”). I my family situation is kind of weird because I live with my mom, my step-dad, and my adopted sister (who is also simultaneously my foster niece and my biological cousin; long story).</p>
    <p>I’m attending for a degree in Software Engineering, which I then plan to use to get into the US Air Force as an officer, so that they can basically subsidize my plans to develop an entire anime series and subsequent MMO intended to subtly encourage fans to learn STEM skills and healthy coping mechanisms for dealing with various types of traumas. My favorite foods are ribeye steaks, macaroni ‘n’ cheese, and crab legs (not at the same time, obviously). A few weird talents I have are that if I write something down (by hand) twice, I’ll remember it for at least a month afterward, I can (to a limited capacity) use my palms as suction cups), and a childhood obsession with Medieval warfare has left me practiced and proficient in swordplay.</p>
